I wasted some time today—I realized it when I looked back at how the time slipped away.

Naturally, I wondered: what went wrong here?

My mind churned for a bit, wrestling with the question, until an answer popped up: _vague thoughts_.

See, I’d been chasing _correct_ judgment, aiming for _correct_ thoughts.

In that pursuit of getting it right, I ended up making things more _complex_.

And that complexity? It spiraled so far that I deluded myself—straying from the simple approach I could’ve taken.

After mulling it over, a kind of **Grid of Action** sprang to mind, and here’s how it looks:

-   _Vague and Wrong_ → No action
-   _Vague and Correct_ → No action
-   _Simple and Wrong_ → Action
-   _Simple and Correct_ → Action

Now, someone might object: “If it’s vague, how can it be judged as correct or wrong?”

Fair point—it’s tricky to pin down something so hazy.

But that’s the thing: both possibilities exist in that murkiness.

Whether it leans right or wrong in effect, it doesn’t matter—it’s a useless exercise either way. Why? Because no action comes of it.

So, here’s the takeaway: if we want to _do_, to stay engaged, to move, to experience life, we’ve got to keep our thoughts simple at all times.

Complexity isn’t the enemy—it can be tackled—but it’s best surmounted through a thousand simple steps.

Each one needs to be manageable, something we can actually grip, if we’re going to act at all.

So complexity is not the enemy, but vagueness definitely is - that of action.
