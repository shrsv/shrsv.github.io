Steve Jobs said taste is paramount to business leaders who wish to do well.

I think that's a bit too abstract to put into practice on a day-to-day
basis.

Instead, I prefer thinking of it this way: "Let's not put more garbage
into the world."

That is, it is a virtue to be critical about one's own works.

When our standards are high, and we refuse to pollute the lives of others
due to greed, impatience, and such vices, we automatically imbibe "taste."

No esoteric or mystical skill required this way.
