There are essentially two types of people: those who are successful and those who ask **defocusing** questions.

A **defocusing** question is something like: "What can I do about this?". This creates a huge list of busywork for you â€“ which keeps you running around for a long time with very little results to show for it.

Instead, try a **FOCUSING** question: "What is **ONE** thing if I do, everything else becomes easier or irrelevant?"

You have to be really careful about it. If you pick an actually important thing, your life will become so much better because of this.
