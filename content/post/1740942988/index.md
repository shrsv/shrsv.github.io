There are two types of people: those who are successful and those who ask defocusing questions.

A **defocusing question** is something like: "What can I do about this?". This creates a huge list of busywork for you - which keeps you running around for a long time with very little results to show for it.

Instead, try a **FOCUSING question**: "What is ONE thing if I do, everything else becomes easier or irrelevant?"

You have to be really careful about it. If you pick an actually important thing - your life will become so much better because of this.
