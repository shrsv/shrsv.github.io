## Mastery Demands Payment in Life Units

Let's think a bit about the 10,000 hour rule.

It says that *mastery* in a serious discipline demands a minimum
focused investment of around 10,000 hours in *deliberate practice*.

Deliberate practice means - finding benchmark behaviors, breaking
them down, and performing them consistently to get nearer
to perfection.

10,000 hours roughly breaks down like this:

- 9 years of effort, given 3 hours per day, 365 days a year
- 13 years of effort, given 2 hours per day, 365 days a year
- 27 years of effort, given 1 hour per day, 365 days year


These are staggering numbers - when we look at how short our lives
are.

Half our lives - we are either sleeping or working on maintenance
tasks.

The other half - we're trapped in various maladies and difficulties
- and rarely give sufficient time and energy to deliberately get
better at something.

For most humans - mastering even 1 serious discipline is a lifetime
achievement.

The vast majority of humans reach their graves having mastered not
a single serious discipline in their lives.

That means, the vast majority of humans have never experienced
peak performance within themselves, they have never known what
it means to fulfill even a portion of their real potentials.

## Why should we care about "Mastery"?

It may sound like a vague word invented by people with too much time
sometimes on their hands.

But really - it isn't.

There are two sides to "Mastery".

First - the less important side: The social side.

A masterful performance is usually judged in a social context.

In any era - we have the top scientists, sportsmen, politicians,
actors, and so on.

We have the historical greats, Newton, Einstein, Beethoven, and on
and on.

We all know their names.

They were much, much better than their contemporaries. Some of them
were better than anyone ever in their fields of expertise.

It is sort of a social peak - and masters are at the top - in
their areas of expertise.

But as I said - there are two sides to "Mastery", and the social
side - of being at the top of list is of lesser importance.

## The More Important Side of "Mastery"

The more important side of "Mastery" is that - it hits at the
core of what it means to be a human.

You may look at the animal kingdom - you'll find no adult animal practicing
getting better in any area of life, and trying to master it.

There is no such effort.

In humans - we can see a higher state and try for it. We understand
this term called "potential".

You know that if you keep practicing, and trying, you will eventually
get better - and the experience of life will change for you.

That is the key driver for Mastery.

And most importantly? The *experience of mastery cannot be bought or
sold in the market*.

Once you've mastered something - the experience you get out of it -
is solely your own. When performing - what you go through psychologically
cannot be counted through numbers.

Nobody can buy your experience. Sure, they may hire you, they may associate
with you - but nobody can buy the experience of mastery.

One struggles for a decade or more - and pay a hefty price in **time, effort
and emotions** -- all for a simple experience of mastery.

And no rich person, or a powerful person, can buy or grab it for themselves.

The only currency through which mastery can be obtained is life itself.

## What Mastery Stands For in Human Life

The desire and effort for mastery in any area of human life stands for
intelligence, the human capacity for envisioning better states, and working
for it.

It is waking up the inner human within the animal, and to help it guide
towards a higher potential.

That is what Mastery means, and it is worth having a few words in our
vocabularies to remind ourselves of such a great potential.
