It’s not every day that I find myself at odds with someone like Jeff Bezos (on a matter of principle, of course).

The man who built Amazon into a global phenomenon once said, **“Good intentions don’t work. Mechanisms do.”**

At first glance, it’s a compelling statement—practical, grounded, and appealing to the results-driven crowd
in business and economic worlds.

But the more I reflect on it, the more I disagree.

I will argue here that intentions, far from being irrelevant, are foundational to improving
the quality of human existence.

My reasons - in short - are as follows:

- Intent is about us - humans; effect is about the world at large.
- Intent is spiritual or psychological in nature; effect is economic or physical in nature (usually).
- Intent is often a relatively long-term phenomenon; mechanism is usually more short-term.


## A bit of history...

Look at the sages, prophets, and spiritual traditions that have guided humanity for millennia.

From Buddhist monks to the wise teachers of ancient India, they’ve all emphasized one thing: *get your intent right*.

Why?

Because intent is tightly coupled to the quality of your consciousness - which,
in the long run, determines actions that lead to the individual and the world's
future.

Contrast this with the economic perspective, where intentions are dismissed as fluff.

Economists and business people often argue that what matters are effects—tangible results, second-order consequences, and measurable outputs.

And mechanisms, they say, are what drive success.

But I think this view misses something fundamental.

## Putting the idea through the "common sense" filter

Let’s test this idea with a simple scenario.

Imagine you’re facing a brain tumor, and you need a neurosurgeon.

You have two options: one is a brilliant technician with a criminal background, whose intentions you distrust; the other is less technical but genuinely committed to your well-being.

Who do you choose?

Most of us, I suspect, would pick the latter.

Why?

Because we instinctively know - intent matters.

We instinctively sense that someone who doesn’t have our best interests at heart—no matter how skilled—can’t be trusted with something as precious as our life.

Mechanisms alone don’t cut it when the stakes are personal.

## Time Horizon

Now, let’s widen the lens.

Consider the longest-standing organizations in history: churches, temples, spiritual lineages, educational institutions, and service-oriented groups.

These entities have endured for decades, centuries, even millennia—often thriving regardless of economic conditions.

Take the Shankaracharya tradition in India, a lineage of wisdom that has persisted for over a thousand years.

It’s not built on economic principles, which are inherently dynamic and unstable, but on an unchanging commitment to truth and human upliftment.

What do these organizations have in common?

They operate on what I call the “Intent Principle” rather than the “Effect Principle.”

Their focus isn’t solely on short-term outputs or market fluctuations; it’s on a deeper, enduring purpose.

And that purpose—rooted in goodwill and noble intent—carries them through storms that topple profit-driven systems.

## Maybe Intent In Itself Can Be Seen As Part of Larger Mechanism

Of course, I’m not saying mechanisms don’t matter.

A well-designed system can amplify the impact of good intentions.

But intent isn’t separate from the mechanism—it’s part of it, especially in human organizations.

When we sense that someone doesn’t wish us well or lacks consideration, we pull away.

That’s the genesis of disorder, distrust, and collapse.

Conversely, when intent is genuine and inspiring, it binds people together, fueling cooperation and resilience.

Intent is the foundation; mechanisms are the structure built upon it.

## The Durability of Intent

Economic systems, by their nature, are concrete but fleeting.

They rise and fall with markets, technologies, and trends.

Intent, on the other hand, is abstract yet enduring.

A noble thought—a commitment to benefit others, to serve a country, or to enhance well-being—can survive generations.

It’s not easily destroyed, even under adverse circumstances.

History shows this: the goodwill and aspirations of our ancestors continue to inspire us long after their physical creations have crumbled.

Think about it: no truly noble thought ever dies.

It plants seeds that bloom into future actions, often in ways we can’t predict.

Mechanisms, being rigid and material, eventually break down.

Intent, being fluid and timeless, adapts and persists.

## A Life Built on Intent

So, where does this leave us?

I believe good intentions matter more than mechanisms—not because they’re a substitute for results, but because they’re the firm ground on which all lasting results rest.

A steadfast commitment to an inspiring intent is the best way to make the most of our lives, both for ourselves and for others.

It’s what drives us and our associates through decades, even lifetimes.

It’s what survives beyond us.

Jeff Bezos might disagree, and the economists might scoff.

But I’d rather take my cues from the sages who’ve stood the test of time.

Get your intent right, and the mechanisms will follow.

That’s the real power of intent.
