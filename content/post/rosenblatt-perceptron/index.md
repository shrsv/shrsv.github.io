In **Smithsonian National Museum of American History** - the following device
is visible:

The device is called the **Mark I Perceptron**.

It was built in 1957.

The chief person behind construction of this device was [Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt)


The device had 3 parts:

1. Stimuli receptor monitor (S)
2. Association machinery (A)
3. Response mechanism (S)

This is almost a mechanical equivalent of what Minsky sort of talks
about in his [*Society of Mind*](http://aurellem.org/society-of-mind/som-5.3.html):

![Minsky's Description](3.png)

> This diagram depicts our sensory machinery as sending information to the brain, wherein it is projected on some inner mental movie screen. Then, inside that ghostly theater, a lurking Self observes the scene and then considers what to do. Finally, that Self may act — somehow reversing all those steps — to influence the real world by sending various signals back through yet another family of remote-control accessories.
-- Marvin Minsky, The Society of Mind

And this is Rosenbaltt tweaking the perceptron:

You can see the NYT reporting that the navy claimed the device
would eventually:

> the embryo of an electronic computer today that it expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.
