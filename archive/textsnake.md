# Text Snake

## Day 1 (17 Nov 2015)

I am going to make a snake game in python. It's going to be very simple. 

I won't be using any outside code. I won't be taking any outside help in designing it. I will build the whole thing from scratch.

I'm more interested in the process of writing code everyday, than in the end result.

I assume the screen size is fixed. 

I assume the screen can display these characters: +, 0-9, a-z. Nothing else.

I will be updating this file everyday.
